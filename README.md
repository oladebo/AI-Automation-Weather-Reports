## AI Weather Report Automation
- Overview

AI Weather Report Automation is a project designed to automatically fetch, process, and deliver daily weather updates using real-time weather APIs. The system extracts key metrics such as high and low temperatures, processes them through automated logic, and generates clear, human-readable summaries—perfect for dashboards, alerts, and decision-making workflows.

By leveraging automation, this project eliminates manual report creation, reduces errors, and ensures timely, consistent, and accurate weather updates.

### Features

- Real-time weather data fetching from APIs

- Automatic parsing of hourly forecasts

- Daily high and low temperature extraction

- Readable, location-specific summaries
